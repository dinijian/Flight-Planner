# Flight-Planner

 In this project, we will determine various flight plans for a person wishing to travel between two cities through an airplane.
 
 We will also calculate the total cost incurred and the total time taken by that person for his/her flight trip and recommend the user the best possible trip according to the   preference cost/time entered by the user.
 
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
In order to store the various flight paths possible we will use the data structure graphs and represent it using adjacency matrix where we will store the city and the various cities it is connected to.

ï‚· The program will print the most efficient flight plans available based on whether the request was to order by time or cost. If no flight plan can be created, then an error message will be output.
